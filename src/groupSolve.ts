/**
 * The solver for every puzzle made of groups: counting, singles, and how deep a guess goes.
 *
 * Three questions, one small engine, for Sudoku, Diagonal, Jigsaw and Sum Cages alike.
 *
 *  - `countSolutions` says whether a puzzle has exactly one answer, which is the whole difference
 *    between a puzzle and a guessing game. It stops at two, so "many" costs no more than "two".
 *  - `applySingles` fills what pure reasoning fills: a cell with one candidate, or a value with one
 *    place left in a group.
 *  - `guessDepth` is the level: 0 when singles finish it, 1 when one guess and singles do, more when
 *    more. A level is what the solver needed, not how many givens were printed: twenty-four givens
 *    can be an easy grid.
 *
 * It reads a `Layout`, the groups that must each hold every number once, so classic Sudoku, Diagonal
 * and Jigsaw are one solver with three lists of groups (see `layout.ts`).
