/**
 * Making a Sudoku (Number Place) puzzle, and its Diagonal variant, from a seed.
 *
 * Two steps. Fill a whole grid by backtracking with the values tried in a seeded order, so the seed
 * decides the grid. Then take cells away in a seeded order, keeping each removal only while the
 * puzzle still has exactly one answer AND stays within the level: an easy puzzle must go on
 * yielding to singles, a medium one to a single guess, a hard one to whatever it takes. The
 * removal stops at the level's floor of givens, so a hard 9×9 does not run every one of its 81
 * cells past the solver for the sake of two more blanks.
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic in the seed. Change this file and every seed makes a different
 * puzzle, and a solve kept as (kind, size, level, seed) is a different one: `site.fixture.test.ts`
 * holds every puzzle itsutsu.com made from its seeds, byte for byte.
