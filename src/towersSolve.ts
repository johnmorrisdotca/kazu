/**
 * The Skyscrapers solver (Towers): counting, the reasoning a person does, and
 * how deep a guess goes.
 *
 * A Latin square whose rows and columns are also seen from outside. The
 * candidates are bitmasks, bit `v` for a tower of height `v`, as in More or
 * Less. It reasons about a clued line at one of two strengths:
 *
 * - `edges`, what a person sees at a glance, and what the levels are measured
 *   by: a 1 means the tallest tower is next to it, a clue as big as the square
 *   means they climb one step at a time, and a clue of `c` caps the `k`th cell
 *   from it at `size − c + k`, since `c − 1` taller towers must still show
 *   behind it. And once a clued line is down to `FEW_LEFT` open cells, every
 *   order of what is left — six at most — is tried in the head, as a person
 *   does; at seven open cells nobody tries 5,040.
 * - `lines`, the general form of all of that, used to COUNT answers and never
 *   to grade them: a height no ordering of 1..size that fits both the cells
 *   and both clues puts in a cell cannot go there. It is far stronger than
 *   anybody's eye — graded by it, nearly every puzzle came out "easy" — and
 *   it is what keeps proving a 7×7 unique down to milliseconds. At seven a
 *   side there are 5,040 orderings, filed once by what they show from each
 *   end, so a clue reads only its own.
